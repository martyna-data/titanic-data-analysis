Data preprocessing and statistical analysis of Titanic passengers dataset in R

# Titanic Data Analysis 🚢
This project explores the Titanic dataset (`titanic_new.csv`) using R, focusing on data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and chi-squared tests.

## 🔧 Methods and tools
- Language: R
- Packages: dplyr, ggplot2, corrplot, e1071
- Techniques: data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, skewness & kurtosis, chi-squared tests

## 📊 What’s included
- Data preprocessing (factor conversion, missing values, feature creation)
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Correlation matrix with `corrplot`
- Chi-squared tests for categorical variables
- Custom plots using `ggplot2`

## 📁 Files
- `titanic_analysis.R` – main R script
- `raport.pdf` – detailed report in Polish
- `titanic_new.csv` – The dataset used in this project is based on the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) from Kaggle.

## 🧠 Key findings
- Survival rates depended strongly on gender and passenger class
- Family size impacted survival probabilities
- Age and fare showed skewed distributions
- Significant correlations between SibSp, Parch and FamilySize
